# Ubuntu Focal Fossa baseimage with s6-overlay

This fork of [linuxserver/docker-baseimage-ubuntu](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-baseimage-ubuntu) doesn't change much.

It is mainly intended as a training ground to learn and gather experience with writing my very own baseimage.

**Linuxserver.io** create beautiful Dockerimages. There isn't really anything to improve that I can see. 

That being said: You probably won't get any use out of this baseimage. If you like the people over at LSIO and their images,
you should continue to use their images. As I said, this is mainly intended as a training ground for me.

I strongly encourage you to show your support to **Linuxserver.io**. Without their images, their complexity, their usability,
I wouldn't be where I am now. I learned a lot of things about Docker by inspecting their images and containers.
